Scenario - Delta Airlines- Data Analytics and Strategy
You've been hired to come in as a data analyst working for Delta Airlines. Delta Airlines is struggling to maintain its competitive edge amidst the increasing presence of low-cost carriers and high regulatory pressures. The airline's current data is siloed, making it difficult to solve customer issues effectively and devise a robust business strategy. Additionally, the 2024 Crowdstrike Incidents have added complexity to their data security and management needs. Delta's objective is to assimilate its data, leveraging AI and CRM solutions to gain comprehensive insights. This will enable them to implement a solid 5 year business strategy that addresses market dynamics and regulatory requirements and keep their competitive edge in the industry.

You will be working with the following data sets: frequent flier data and revenue data. 

Task:
1. Review the Dataset: Examine the dataset to understand its structure and identify any obvious errors or inconsistencies.
2. Identify Missing Data: Use tools to detect and handle missing values appropriately.
3. Correct Inconsistencies: Look for and correct inconsistencies such as duplicate records, incorrect data types, and outliers.
4. Standardize Data: Ensure that data formats are consistent across the dataset (e.g., date formats, categorical values).
5. Document Changes: Keep a record of all changes made during the data cleansing process.

Your goal is to choose the best predictive model for attrition rates.
